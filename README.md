## About
This add-on was a requested fan-based creation when the first installment of the 3rd Life series was launched. The premise is simple: You get 3 lives. If you lose them all, you are sent to a "spectator" mode. Recreations of Last Life and Double Life have been considered, however no formal plans have been made.

This add-on has not been updated in a while, but is still available. Use at your own risk.
